1. A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its
 performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather
 data, and have it learn to predict weather. What would be a reasonable choice for P?
