## Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
---
1. Suppose m=4 students have taken some class, and the class had a midterm exam and a final exam. You have collected a dataset of their scores on the two exams, which is as follows:
You'd like to use polynomial regression to predict a student's final exam score from their midterm exam score. Concretely, suppose you want to fit a model of the form h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 , where x_1 is the midterm score and x_2 is (midterm score)^2 2 . Further, you plan to use both feature scaling (dividing by the "max-min", or range, of a feature) and mean normalization. What is the normalized feature x_1^{(3)}x 1 (3) â€‹ ? (Hint: midterm = 94, final = 87 is training example 3.) Please round off your answer to two decimal places and enter in the text box below.
